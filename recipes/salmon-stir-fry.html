        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul> 
                <li>2 tsp sesame seeds</li>
                <li>2 skinless salmon fillets (approx. 120g/4⅓oz each)</li>
                <li>1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil</li>
                <li>½ red onion, cut into 8–10 wedges</li>
                <li>1 red pepper, deseeded and thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1 carrot, thinly sliced</li>
                <li> 125g/4½oz broccoli, cut into small florets</li>
                <li>25g/1oz unsalted cashew nuts, halved</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>15g/½oz fresh root ginger, peeled and cut into tiny matchsticks</li>
                <li>1 tsp cornflour</li>
                <li>1 tsp dark soy sauce</li>
                <li>½ unwaxed lemon, grated zest and juice only</li>
                <li>150ml/¼ pint vegetable stock</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol> 
                <li>Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of the sesame seeds over the top of each salmon fillet and press down lightly to help them stick.</li>
                <li>Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat and cook the salmon fillets, seed-side down, for 2 minutes, or until lightly browned. Turn and cook the other side for 2 minutes. Then flip gently and cook for a further 1 minute on each side. Transfer to a plate.</li>
                <li>Return the pan to the heat, add the remaining oil and stir-fry the onion, pepper, carrot and broccoli for 4 minutes. Add the cashews and stir-fry for 2 minutes, until the vegetables are tender-crisp and the nuts are beginning to brown. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for a further minute, stirring regularly.</li>
                <li>Mix the cornflour with the soy sauce and lemon juice in a small bowl. Add the stock to the pan, pour in the lemon mixture and bring to a simmer. Cook for 10–20 seconds, stirring, until the sauce is slightly thickened.</li>
                <li>Return the salmon to the pan, nestling it among the vegetables, and heat through without stirring for 1–2 minutes. Sprinkle with grated lemon zest and serve.</li>
