1st project - bery basic html recipe page

Description of project - very basic recipe page including a homepage and 3 recipe pages. Each page contains a picture, a brief description containing some information about the dish, an ingredients list (unordered) and an instructions list (ordered).


Skills demonstrated
 - Using GIT to save different versions of the project during development. - And logging each step (could've been more descriptive maybe).
 - Using basic html tags e.g. different headings, images, links, paragprahs, lists etc.

Reflection (Presentation)
  - Lasagne image was too big (its height meant scrolling down to see any other content).
  - I used 3 slightly different methods to present the cooking instructions: for the lasagna, I gave each step a heading. For the steak, I enclosed the text in the ordered list
    with paragraph tags, which meant that each step was nicely spaced from one-another (by an empty line). 
    For the salmon, I just left the text in the ordered list tags, meaning they were on adjacent lines. 
    I also presented certain information e.g. macros on one page, but not on the others.
  - Using the same presentation for each recipe, and including the same information, would've been a better choice, ensuring consistency across the website.

Reflection (Development)
 - Overall, didn't struggle to do any of these tasks - the main difficulty was the laborious act of moving text e.g. the ingredients and instructions, to my page.(Do we really have to write lists line by line using many list tags? Is there no way to use just one tag for one list and seperate the lines of the list with some code?)
 - I'm sure I could present the code better to improve readability, e.g. I have entire paragraphs on one line - maybe theres a better solution so you don't have to keep      scrolling across.
